4) Constructor: Constructor is a special type of method which has same name has class name
       Types of Constructor are
       * Default Constructor : Default Constructor means no-arg constructor , and also it is inbuilt, and it gives
	   default values of the given dataType.
       * Parameter Constructor: Parameter constructor are user defined constructor where programmer can provide 
         parameters with in the parantisis of the constructor.

1)* public static void main(String arg[])
   public is acess specifier
    static is non acess specifier
    void is return type
     main method name
    String arg[] is a command line argument
   
   *JVM: Java Vertual Machine, jvm converts .java file to .class file
      jvm performs some task before executing the programm.
	  1) loads the byte code
	  2) verifies the byte code
	  3) executes the byte code
	  and also it provide untime environment to byte code
    JRE:Java Runtime Environment , it contains jvm + set of libraries
	JDK:Java gDevelopment Kit, it contains jre+development tools 

    *class: a class is a real time entity , it is a blue print of an object
	 object: it is a instance of a class,object has states and behaviour

5) this keyword is used to differenciate the instance variables and parameter variables
   this() is used when the const should be called in another const of same class
   
6) the main method is static because there is no necssity to create the object and firstly static properties will executes so main method is static and it belongs to its own class
    there are two types of methods 
   * pre-defined method
   *user defined method

12)yes

10)No 
  we can overload the const by constructor chaining by calling one const inside the other const in the same class   

3)public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		System.out.println("Enter the string ");
		
		Scanner sp = new Scanner(System.in);
		 String name= sp.next();
		 char ch[] = name.toCharArray();
		String rev = "";
		
		
		for(int i=ch.length-1;i>=0;i--) {
			rev=rev+ch[i];
			
		}
		System.out.println("Original string :"+name);
		System.out.println("Reverse string :"+rev);
	
	}
