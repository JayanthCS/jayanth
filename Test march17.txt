                                                TEST
												
												
  1) The components of java are:
     *JDK
     *JRE	 
     *JVM
	 
   * JVM:Java virtual machine 	 
         Jvm provides runtime environment for the bytecode.
		 the main tasks of jvm are
		 * It loads the byte code
		 * It verifies the byte code
		 * It execute the byte code
   * JRE:Java RunTime Environment
         JRE contains jvm+set of libreries
		 
   * JDK : Java Development Kit
         JDK contains JRE+Development tools like doc,files.

  2)Features of java are 
    * Java is object oriented programming language
	* It is platform independent
	* Code reusability
	* It is secure
	
  3) Constructor: Constructor is a special type of method which has same name has class name
       Types of Constructor are
       * Default Constructor : Default Constructor means no-arg constructor , and also it is inbuilt, and it gives
	   default values of the given dataType.
       * Parameter Constructor: Parameter constructor are user defined constructor where programmer can provide 
         parameters with in the parantisis of the constructor.
		 
   4)Variables: Variable is a container where we can store the data, and that data can be used in further program.
     Types of Variables
	 *Static variable:The variables written out side the method and inside the class is called Static Variables
	 we can asscess satic variables by className.
     *Local variable:variables written inside the method body is called Local variables
     *Instance variable:variables written inside the class 
     *Parameter variable:variables written inside the parantisis of the method or constructor is called Parameter variables.	 
   
   5)Because in some condition java dont support some oops concepts like Inheritance of multi-level,it is achived by interface
   
   6)Dynamic binding means compilation 
     Static binding means runtime

   7)OOPs concepts:
     1.Polymorphism:poly means many , morphism means form it means one calss having differnt forms
      Ex: OverLoad method is the example for polymorphism
         Methods having same name and differnt parameters is called overloding which is the example for polymorphism.	  
     2.Inheritance:Inheriting or accuring the properties and behavior of parent class to the child class is Inheritance.
	 Inheritance can be achived by extending the super most class in the subclass by using extends key word.
	 it gives has a relationship.
	 Types of Inheritance
	 *Single inheritance:one class inherits the properties of one parent class.
     *Multi-Level inheritance: It is the chaining of inheritance where one class has a relationship with superclass 
	 and that superclass has a relationship with another superclass.	 
	 *Hirarcical inheritance:Where two child class inherits the property of one parent class
	 *multiple inheritance: Where single child class inherits the properties of two parent class
	 this inheritance is not supported in java due to ambugity .
	 it can be achived by interface.
	 3.Encapsulation:Encapsulation means wrapping the data into a single unit is called Encapsulation.
       By using getter and setter method we can access the private members in the class
       getter method is used read-only purpose
       setter method is used write-only purpose
     4.Abstraction:Hiding the implimentation and providing the neccesary data to the users.
       

    11)Interface: Interface which connect the two classes like a bridge.
      where implementation class will implements the properties in interface class.It is is-a relationship
      where usage class associates with interface .It is has-a relationship. 

    13)Access Specifiers:
      public : we can access out side the class and out side the package also.
      private: we cannot access out side the package.
      protected: we canot access out side the class and also in package.
      final : we cannot access final properties .
